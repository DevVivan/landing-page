This was landing page, the [*2nd project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) within the Odin Project curriculum. This was an assignment designed to make students create an entire web page from a design provided.

In this recipes project, I revised my CSS knowledge, applying the basics of flexbox to align and alter the layout of my landing page. Following the design image and the fonts & colors image, I gave my attempt in re-creating a page to to the best of my abilities
